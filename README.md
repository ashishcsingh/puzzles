Most of the common problems/puzzles with What/How comments towards a clean solution.

Categorized by choice of Data-structures and algorithms:
arrays/linkedlist/tree/string/hashmap/graph/thread/logic/dynamic/bits.

All test methods are wrapped in their corresponding file_test.cpp and invoked from main.cpp
